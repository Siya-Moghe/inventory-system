Reflection 

**1. Which issues were the easiest to fix, and which were the hardest? Why?**
The easiest to fix was replacing except: clauses with "except Exception as e:" clauses. Where exception is the name of specific exceptions like FileNotFound 
or json.JSONDecode 

2. Did the static analysis tools report any false positives? If so, describe one example.
3. How would you integrate static analysis tools into your actual software development
workflow? Consider continuous integration (CI) or local development practices.
4. What tangible improvements did you observe in the code quality, readability, or potential
robustness after applying the fixes?
